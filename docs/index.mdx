## Welcome to iPad Cursor

Add fluid, native-feeling iPad cursor interactions to your React applications. This library provides a custom cursor that morphs, snaps, and adapts to interactive elements, mimicking the polished experience of iPadOS.

## Setting the Scene

Most web cursors are boring. They sit there, pointing at things, disconnected from the UI they interact with.

**The iPad Cursor** changes that. It's fluid, organic, and physically aware of the elements it touches. It doesn't just point; it morphs, snaps, and glows.

## Key Features

- **Morphing Cursor**: The cursor smoothly transforms between a dot, a text beam, and a block shape.
- **Magnetic Effect**: Buttons and interactive elements attract the cursor, creating a satisfying snap effect.
- **Text Adaptation**: Automatically detects text size and line height to match the cursor beam perfectly.
- **Premium Feel**: Physics-based animations for natural movement and interaction.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Built for React, compatible with Next.js, and easily adaptable.
