## Key Features

- **Morphing Cursor**: The cursor smoothly transforms between a dot, a text beam, and a block shape.
- **Magnetic Effect**: Buttons and interactive elements attract the cursor, creating a satisfying snap effect.
- **Text Adaptation**: Automatically detects text size and line height to match the cursor beam perfectly.
- **Premium Feel**: Physics-based animations for natural movement and interaction.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Built for React, compatible with Next.js, and easily adaptable.
