## Setting the Scene

Most web cursors are boring. They sit there, pointing at things, disconnected from the UI they interact with.

**The iPad Cursor** changes that. It's fluid, organic, and physically aware of the elements it touches. It doesn't just point; it morphs, snaps, and glows.

## Features

- **Morphing Physics**: The cursor smoothly transforms its shape to match the interactive elements it hovers over.
- **Magnetic Attraction**: Elements are pulled towards the cursor slightly, creating a tangible connection.
- **Sticky Tracking**: For drag-and-drop interfaces, the cursor locks onto elements for precise control.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: A subtle bloom effect follows the cursor inside block elements, adding depth.
- **Optimized for Mouse**: Best used on desktop devices with fine pointing devices.

## Quick Example

Wrap any button or link to give it the magic touch:

```jsx
import { CursorTarget } from '@/components/cursor/CursorTarget';

function MyButton() {
  return (
    <CursorTarget>
      <button className="px-6 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-lg">
        Hover Me
      </button>
    </CursorTarget>
  );
}
```
