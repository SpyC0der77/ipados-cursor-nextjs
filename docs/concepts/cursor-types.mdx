The iPad Cursor adapts its shape and behavior based on the content it is interacting with. There are three primary cursor types:

## Default (Dot)

The default state of the cursor is a small, translucent circle (dot). This is used when the cursor is navigating empty space or non-interactive elements.

- **Appearance**: Small circle
- **Usage**: General navigation

## Block

The `block` type is designed for interactive elements like buttons, cards, and navigation items. When hovering over a target with `type="block"`, the cursor:

1. Morphs into the shape of the element (rounded rectangle).
2. Snaps to the element's position.
3. Applies a subtle magnetic effect to the element itself.
4. Adds a lighting effect that follows the mouse position within the block.

```tsx
<CursorTarget type="block">
  <button>Click Me</button>
</CursorTarget>
```

## Text

The `text` type is specialized for text content, links, and input fields. When hovering over a target with `type="text"`, the cursor:

1. Morphs into a vertical beam (caret).
2. Matches the height of the text line.
3. Snaps to the text content.

```tsx
<CursorTarget type="text">
  <a href="#">Read More</a>
</CursorTarget>
```
