title: Magnetic Effect
description: "How the magnetic attraction works"
---

One of the signature features of the iPad cursor is the "magnetic" effect. This creates a tactile connection between the user's input and the UI elements.

## How it works

When the cursor approaches a magnetic element (usually a `block` type), the element itself is slightly pulled towards the cursor. This indicates interactivity and makes the interface feel alive.

### Configuration

You can control the intensity of this effect using the `magnetic` prop on `CursorTarget` or globally in the configuration.

- **`magnetic={true}`** (Default): The element will move slightly towards the cursor.
- **`magnetic={false}`**: The element remains static, but the cursor still snaps to it.

```tsx
<CursorTarget type="block" magnetic={false}>
  <div className="card">Static Card</div>
</CursorTarget>
```

### Stickiness

For an even stronger effect, you can enable `stickiness`. This makes the cursor "stick" to the center of the element more aggressively, useful for smaller circular buttons or icons.

```tsx
<CursorTarget type="block" stickiness={true}>
  <button className="icon-btn">X</button>
</CursorTarget>
```
